## Requirements and How To's 
#### LEM movement and rotation
#### AGL detection using ray intersection
This one is very simple. What this allows us to do is show AGL statistics from a given altitude on the screen. 
Additionally, we've added a ray from the lander to the ground to help better visualize.
> To enable this, simple press the 'G' button to toggle on and off. AGL stats will be on the top right of the
> window.
