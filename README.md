# 134 Final Project README! 
#### Pio Romo, Schuyler Ng aka the Super Mario Bros

## Requirements and How To's 
#### LEM movement and rotation
###### Schulyer Ng
This allows us to move the LEM left, right, up, down, and even rotate. 
> The 'A' and 'D' key allows you to rotate left and right, respectively.
> The 'W' and 'S' key allows you to move left and right, respectively.
> The 'Shift' key moves the lander upwards. The 'CTRL' key moves it down. 
#### AGL detection using ray intersection
###### Pio Romo
This one is very simple. What this allows us to do is show AGL statistics from a given altitude on the screen. 
Additionally, we've added a ray from the lander to the ground to help better visualize.
> To enable this, simple press the 'G' button to toggle on and off. AGL stats will be on the top right of the
> window.
